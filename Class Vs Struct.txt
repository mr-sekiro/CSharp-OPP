In C#, both classes and structures are used to define custom data types that can contain fields, properties, methods, and events.
However, there are some differences between them. Here are some of the main differences between classes and structures in C#:

Syntax: Classes are defined using the "class" keyword, followed by the class name and the class body, which contains the class members.
Structures are defined using the "struct" keyword, followed by the struct name and the struct body, which also contains the struct members.

Inheritance: Classes can be inherited by other classes to create a hierarchy of related classes,
structures cannot be inherited or derived from other structures.

Default constructor: Classes have a default constructor that is automatically provided by the compiler if a constructor is not explicitly defined.
Structures, on the other hand, do not have a default constructor and require all fields to be initialized explicitly.

Reference type vs Value type: Classes are reference types, which means that when an instance of a class is created, a reference to that instance is returned.
Structures are value types, which means that when an instance of a structure is created, the value of the instance is returned.

Performance: Structures are generally faster than classes for small, simple types, as they are stored on the stack rather than the heap.
This means that accessing and manipulating a structure's fields can be faster than accessing and manipulating a class's fields.

Memory management: Since structures are value types, they are allocated on the stack, which is a limited resource,
while classes are allocated on the heap, which is a larger, more flexible memory pool.
This means that using too many structures or large structures can quickly consume the available stack memory, causing a stack overflow error.
